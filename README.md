# FlashCardProj

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Change into the new directory.
3. Load up index2.html to see the landing page, or index.html to see the main page.
4. The purpose of the code is to create a flashcard interface that allows user's to use flashcards.




## Purpose 

This game was created by Torrey Thomas as a simple flashcard interface in which users can click and hold onto a flash card in order to flip the cards back and forth. By pressing the buttons at the top. the user will be able to toggle cards they need to review and cards that they already know. They will also be able to toggle and see the background video without the cards being in the way. 


## Unsolved Problems

At the moment, the next step is to first, complete the Javascript code neccessary to flip a card using Vanilla JS as well as add a few features including creating a new card.


## Languages and Frameworks

Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three languages used on this. I created this website with Visual Studio Code and it is launched on Github Pages.

## Approach Taken

The approach that I took was to first visualize the page that I wanted. I then focused an entire day on the styling of the CSS and HTML to get as much functionality out of the way as possible so that the website would work and look smoothly so that the Javascript would be that much easier. After creating all of the main page styling and information, I then created a landing page and a help page in order to make it easier to navigate the site and make the site look nicer as well. I then added some Javascript Functionality.
