## Live Website

https://torreythomas.github.io/Flashcards/


## Purpose 
The purpose of this game is to test the user's knowledge of the NBA MVP's over the past two decades. 

## Unsolved Problems

At the moment, the next step is to first, complete the Javascript code neccessary to flip a card using Vanilla JS as well as add a few features including creating a new card.


## Languages and Frameworks

Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three languages used on this. I created this website with Visual Studio Code and it is launched on Github Pages.

## Approach Taken
I chose to focus on simplicity as the core of this design. The site isn't overbearing or confusing to the eye and yet, it get's the job done. The UX is clean and simple and can be figured out without much instruction. I decided to get the simple game layout first, then come back and implement some more complex changes. These changes are still be updated.
